*Notes.txt*

Mostly stuff that I found important in CS 388 â€“ Unix Systems Programming.

Some important shell commands, vim commands, find, grep, awk, sed & shell scripting.

---
*karabiner.json*

Complex keyboard modifications for macOS, **need karabiner elements software.**

Place in `~/.config`

Current modifications:
* CAPS Lock -> META key 
* META + ijkl for directional arrows

---
*vimrc*

My (rather lackluster) vimrc.

Includes Pathogen for autocompletion and NERDTree.

---
*zshrc*

Configured with OhMyZSH
